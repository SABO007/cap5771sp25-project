# 📚 Student Job & Course Recommendation System

A data science project that helps students discover personalized online courses and job opportunities based on their academic background, skills, and career goals. This system uses machine learning models and a user-friendly Streamlit interface to make real-time predictions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Students often struggle to identify the right career path or relevant learning resources. Our system bridges that gap using:

- Student profile analysis (academic data + skillset)
- Machine learning for course category prediction
- Cosine similarity for job-role matching
- Real-time recommendations via an interactive dashboard

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages & Libraries**
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (ML models & evaluation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
- Streamlit (dashboard)

**Tools**
- Visual Studio Code
- Joblib (model serialization)
