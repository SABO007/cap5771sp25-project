## **Student Job and Course Recommendation System**

### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a personalized recommendation system for students, helping them find suitable job opportunities and courses based on their individual profiles. The system will suggest jobs by analyzing factors like a student’s academic branch, 12th-grade percentage, skills, and career goals. It will also recommend courses that help bridge skill gaps or provide additional learning to help students achieve their career aspirations.
